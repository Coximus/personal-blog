I've had an interest in photography for a long time, but in reality, Ive never really had much of an idea about what it means to take a decent photo. I've had a Canon DSLR for time, but it always remained in auto mode. I had zero idea about apature settings and shutter speeds, and even less of an idea about ISO.

I bought me an the wife an online photography course from [The School of Photography](https://www.theschoolofphotography.com/) and I treated myself to a Nikon Z6 II.

My father in-law is a keen photographer and he goes on a couple of group photography trips a year, and has produced some fantastic photographs. We decided therefore that the 3 of us (me, the wife and the father in-law) should take a trip to the Lake District and practise what we had learned online.

We stayed at the Old Stamp House in the middle of Ambleside. It was a great location, easy to get to and plenty of places to eat and drink, but also, so many amazing places nearby to photgraph.

We first visited Rydal Water for sun rise and took a few down by the water's edge. Then ventured up to Rydal Cave and took what I thought were a couple of decent shots. It wasn't until later when my father in-law asked what ISO I had it set to, and realised that it was set to auto, an most of my photos were at something crazy like 14400 due to my complete lake of understanding of how to control my camera.

I was however pleased to see that at the end of the day there was a huge difference in quality of the photos taken at the beginning of the day vs those taken at the end of the day. Which you'll hopefully see in the gallery.
