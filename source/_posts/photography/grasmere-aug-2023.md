Today me and the wife went back up to The Lake District for the day as we're not far from there and we love it. The intention wasn't to turn this into a photography trip, however, I took my camera just in case.

I had with me my Nikon Z6 II, Kase Wolverine filters, and my new 28-400mm lens, and really just wanted to give it a try. 

We parked up at Grasmere at about 9am, in the car park just past the Daffodil Hotel, walked into the town for a brew and some breakfast and then walked towards Grasmere lake. We walked an anti-clockwise loop around the lake until you get to the beach (which is a great spot for paddle boarding), then carried on to Rydal Water. From there we walked up to the cave at Rydal and looped back to the beach at Grasmere and back along the road in a figure of 8.

It was about a 10km walk in all, but there were some fantasic opportunities along the route to continue my journey into photography.

Today I was mainly trying to practice 2 things: composition, and making sure I was focusing correctly, as I had been neglecting to set my focal point when I have been out recently.

It was a really bright & sunny day, which was great for hiking, not so great for taking interesting shots. I did my best though.

I've got a couple of shot in the gallery which I am happy with, and quite a few which are mediocre. I am, however, not a fan of only showcasing the best examples, I prefer to show the journey. I still don't think I'm a good photographer yet, but every time I go out, I feel like I learn something new, and am slowly getting better.
