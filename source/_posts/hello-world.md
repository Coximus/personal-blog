I'm looking to relaunch my site for all things related to my projects and hobbies. This is my trial of Hexo as a framework
When a chat to people about some of the stuff I've been working on, I always get asked if there is somewhere I post about it. This aims to be that place.

## What to expect.

### Photography

I have recently started heading out more and more with my camera. I'll be showcasing anything that I'm actually happy/proud of.

### Programming / Tech Engineering / Random Projects

At any given time I have at least 10 different projects on the go. I'll do my best to document them and share anything that might be of interest.

### 3D Design

I tend to mess around in blender either making models for printing, assets for 3D games, interior design, or just generally learning.
